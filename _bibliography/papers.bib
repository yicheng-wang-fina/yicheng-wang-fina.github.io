  title={Estimating Investor Demand Elasticity with Endogenous Firm Responses: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flow Shocks},
  author={Wang, Yicheng},
  abstract={This paper addresses an identification challenge in estimating investor demand elasticity: firms actively react to price pressures by adjusting equity issuance, creating endogenous feedback to firm value that biases traditional estimates. Using mutual fund flow shocks, I document that firms experience both positive stock returns and increased equity issuance following unexpected fund inflows. These price responses therefore reflect both exogenous demand pressure and endogenous improvements in fundamental value through strategic firm actions. To overcome this identification problem, I develop a dynamic structural model capturing strategic interactions among firms, mutual funds, and residual investors. Estimating the model via indirect inference, I find a price elasticity of 2.4 for residual investors-substantially higher than previous estimates that ignore firm responses. Counterfactual analyses reveal more moderate capital misallocation effects than prior literature suggests, as strategic interactions cause marginal price effects to diminish rapidly with the size of demand shocks.},

  title={Monetary Policy, Diagnostic Expectations and Customer Capital},
  author={Chen, Yuchen and Wang, Yicheng},
  abstract={We examine how managers' diagnostic expectations about firm profitability and customer acquisition affect the allocative efficiency of monetary policy. Empirically, overpessimistic firms with higher earnings forecast errors show greater sensitivity in intangible investment, particularly in advertising-intensive industries. We develop a heterogeneousfirm New Keynesian model where managers extrapolate idiosyncratic productivity news and balance future versus current profit in customer acquisition. The model predicts a hump-shaped aggregate productivity response as capital reallocates toward high-markup, high-productivity firms over time. Moreover, assuming rational expectations underestimates the increase in aggregate output by 33%, highlighting the role of belief-driven distortions in monetary transmission.},

  title={Granular Markups and Inflation Surge: The Role of Managerial Incentives},
  author={Chen, Yuchen and Salomao, Juliana and Sharma, Varun and Wang, Yicheng},
  abstract={We develop a novel methodology to estimate firm-specific markup premiums using highly granular product-level data that controls for common shocks, isolating the premium as a residual. We validate this measure by comparing it to existing accountingbased estimates and by showing that it exhibits expected correlations with firm size and market share. Unlike traditional approaches, our method can be applied to both public and private firms, enabling an analysis of how financial structure and managerial incentives influence pricing decisions. We find that financial structure matters: public firms systematically increase markups following an IPO. Moreover, during the 2021-2022 inflation surge, publicly listed firms expanded their margins by capitalizing on inflationary pressures-especially among firms with high retail ownership, large early-pandemic stock declines, and strong equity-based pay incentives.},
